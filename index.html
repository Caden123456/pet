		<h2>Very fluffy</h2>
		<img src="penguin.jpg">
		<p>Penguins are quite honestly the best pet to ever have, which is why I don't have one. They are very fluffy, as their fur is very soft. That's what I think at least, I wouldn't know because I don't have one.</p>

		<p>Penguins are kinda weird. Whenever they get into another penguin's territory, they stretch their necks out, and then just scream really loudly.</p>

		<h2>Very nice</h2>
		<img src="penguinfourth.jpg" width="250px">
		<p>Penguins are pretty nice animals. They're nice mainly because there are not many predators in their natural habitats, meaning they don't fight much, and thus become pretty friendly animals. How nice!</p>
